# Micro‑Mood Journal

## Inspiration
I built it for struggling students stuck in their heads, or cant get their emotions out.

## What it does
It prompts them to write a journal and then it will give them advice based on the overall mood.

## How it works
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- Calls an AI API endpoint to analyze text.
- Saves entries by date and renders a mood chart.

## How to run locally
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (or run a simple static server).
